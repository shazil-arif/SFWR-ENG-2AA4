\maketitle

The purpose of the learning log is to reflect upon your progress in learning the
content of SE 2AA4/ CS 2ME3.  This is a personal journal.  The intention is for
you to be aware of your progress by means of recording and reflecting.  A
template is provided for each week.  You should fill in the question marks.  You
are also free to add your own subsections.

\section {Week \theweeknum \addtocounter{weeknum}{1} Intro to Course}

\subsubsection *{Dates} Jan 6 to Jan 10

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Introduction to Course}

Discuss Course administrative details, marking scheme, material and content to be taught

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Software
  Engineering Profession}

Discussed the differences between studying Computer Science and Software Engineering, History of Software Engineering and some important figures such as Parnas

\subsubsection *{Tutorial \thetutnum \addtocounter{tutnum}{1} Git, Doxygen and A1}

Learnt how to install Doxygen, Tex, Git and set up necessary tools and development environment to complete assignments

\subsubsection *{Textbook Reading (Ghezzi, H\&S or other)}

I did not read the book this week

\subsubsection *{Assignment Progress}

Finished the coding and testing portions

\subsubsection *{Midterm/Final Review Progress}

Have not started

\subsubsection *{Reflection Relating Course Topics, Other Courses, Other Experiences}

The discussion board is quite helpful. I find that this course really helps you understand deeply what "Software Engineering" really is. It focuses on the practical aspects of the profession rather than just programming.

\section {Week \theweeknum \addtocounter{weeknum}{1} Software Qualities, Software Engineering Principles}

\subsubsection *{Dates} Jan 13 to Jan 17

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Software Qualities}

Discussed Software qualities such as correctness, robustness, reliability, portability, maintainibility, etc.. Comparing and contrasting different terminology

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Software Engineering principles}

Discussed key SE principles including abstraction, information hiding, designing for change, seperation of concerns and more

\subsubsection *{Tutorial \thetutnum \addtocounter{tutnum}{1} Basics of Latex and PEP8 convention for Python}

Learnt the basics of latex, syntax, different editors etc. Disucssed the PEP8 standards 

\subsubsection *{Textbook Reading (Ghezzi, H\&S or other)}

Have not started :-(

\subsubsection *{Assignment Progress}

Nearly complete. missing a few tests for pos adt

\subsubsection *{Midterm/Final Review Progress}

Have not started reviewing

\subsubsection *{Reflection Relating Course Topics, Other Courses, Other Experiences}

It is nice to see many different software engineering principles, methods and practices being defined in detail and how to apply them

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section {Week \theweeknum \addtocounter{weeknum}{1} Introduction to modules and Mathematics for MIS }

\subsubsection *{Dates} Jan 20 to Jan 24

\subsubsection *{Lecture \thelectnum \addtocounter{lectnum}{1} Introduction to Modules}

Important goals to keep in mind when developing software such as Design for change and Product families.
Discussed The module interface, module implementation

Information Hiding:
Basis for design
Implementation secrets are hidden from clients
Encapsulate changeable design decisions as implementation secrets within module implementations
Encapsulate changeable design decisions as implementation secrets with module implementations

The WRONG ANS: HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH Security and HIDING DATA, VARIABLES 

Important for midterm! internalize it

Discussed examples of modules such as record, library, abstract data type, generic modules
Note: follow precise terminology from Ghezzi textbook

Difference between a library and module
Library: Has no state information or record of any stored data. E.g a Math library that has functions that take inputs and gives outputs
Module: Has state information and some record of data (a ADT module?)

When implementing a specification must match it, not look like it
